#WebDevBBQ Presentation: Future of JavaScript

**Date**: 22th September 2016
**Author**: David Lorenz
**Web**: activenode.io

##Explanation
This git repository contains a lot of  sample files for JS features.
The files should be run with `babel-node` to ensure that they will run.

Files that will not run (by now) and only serve as example:

- PadString.js
- Maths_Samples.js


To run all the other files just run `npm i` and `npm install -g babel-cli`
